## Summary
Based the results of the analysis there is some positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program. The reason being is that even non-Vine members given a lot of 5 star reviews. The Vine members 5 star percentage was also the highest amoung the star ratings at 41.62%. It is very similar when compared to the non-Vine mnembers which had a high 5 star ratings at 53.02%. One additional analysis that we could perform with the data set is figure out which products had 2 stars or less to figure out why they received such low ratings.
